I am a graduate class of 2023 with a profound interest in technology eager to learn and solve and find problems.

## Objective

My journey in taking the Google Cybersecurity Certification has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst or a entry level Penetration tester to gain hands on experience and to put what I learned on the field.
